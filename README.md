Tool to fetch the comments from YouTube videos and analyze the sentiments.

- Developed a Flask-based web interface to fetch and analyze comments from YouTube videos via the YouTube Data API.

- Data preprocessing is implemented for dataset cleansing and subsequent training of the sentiment analysis model in scenarios where model files are missing.
- A summary of sentiment analysis is generated, including counts of positive and negative comments, as well as a percentage rating based on positive comments.
